About
=======

This is a toy program I wrote to learn PyQt and hone my python skills. It renders the
colors of the rainbows at different resolution and with different color depts. It has
several adjustable controls for the way you want it rendered.

The conversion from wavelength to RGB uses code code found at 
http://www.noah.org/wiki/Wavelength_to_RGB_in_Python,
which again is based on FORTRAN code by Dan Bruton
http://www.physics.sfasu.edu/astro/color/spectra.html

Usage
=======

Either install an executable version for your platform or run `python run.py` from the
project folder.
